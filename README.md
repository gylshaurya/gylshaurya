# Hi, I'm Shaurya

I'm a student at IIT Roorkee who loves to Build things. I am fluent in Python, C++ and Javascript and am experienced in Vanilla Web Development. I have also built multiple Android Apps in the past and have also done robotics with Arduino and Esp32. I am currently learning Web3 and Smart Contract Development in Solidity.

Some of my recent projects include:

- **Scidea** - A Community Platform for Science Ideas. A modern and minimalistic UI with feature like upvoting, categories of Ideas, bookmarks, profiles, and dynamic tabs. The backend is bulit in Django and the frontend is simple Html, Css and JS, PostgreSQL is being used for the database.
- **Helion** - A 2D Solar System Simulator with a custom Physics Engine in which users can create, change, and observe their own Solar Sytems. It is builty almost entirely on Javascript. 
- **MOPS** - Mobile OnChain Patient System, A single database for securely storing a patient's entire medical history on blockchain which assits doctors in treatment. The front end is built on vannila and Etherum test net is being used to fetch the patient using Smart Contracts written in Solidity.
- **Splitz** - A Smart Bill-Splitting mobile app that extracts prices from receipts and divides them among friends based on the portion they ate also adjusting tax instantly. It is built with Android Studio using Kotlin as the language
- **Baddy** - A training robot for badminton which is capable of serving shuttles anywhere on the court and can be contolled using a mobile app. The robot is made using Arduino and the app is also made via Android Studio in kotlin.
