# Hi, I'm Shaurya

I'm a student at IIT Roorkee who loves to build things. I am currently doing Blockchain Development. I am fluent in JavaScript and Python and am also experienced in Web Development. I have also built Android apps in the past and have also done robotics with Arduino and ESP32.

Some of my recent projects include:

- **Proof Of Fix** - A dApp that identifies problems, helps citizens vote on which problems matter most, and fund their solutions in a transparent way using blockchain. The project combines Public Goods governance and DeFi concepts. Public goods are handled through community voting, and DeFi is used through an escrow-based funding system that releases money only when work is approved.
- **Helion** - A 2D Solar System Simulator with a custom Physics Engine in which users can create, change, and observe their own solar systems. It is built almost entirely in JavaScript. 
- **M.O.P.S** - Mobile OnChain Patient System, A single database for securely storing a patient's entire medical history on blockchain which assists doctors in treatment. The front end is built on vanilla and Ethereum test net is being used to fetch the patient data using Smart Contracts written in Solidity.
- **Splitz** - A Smart Bill-Splitting mobile app that extracts prices from receipts and divides them among friends based on the portion they ate, also adjusting tax instantly. It is made with kotlin using Android Studio.
- **Baddy** - A training robot for badminton capable of serving shuttles anywhere on the court and can be controlled using a mobile app. The robot is made with Arduino and the app is made with kotlin using Android Studio.
